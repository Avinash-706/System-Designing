    "## What is System Design?\n",
    "\n",
    "System design is the process of defining the architecture, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements. It's about translating high-level concepts into a concrete plan for building a software application or system.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Goals of Effective System Design:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Scalability:** The ability of a system to handle a growing amount of work by adding resources.\n",
    "*   **Reliability:** The probability that a system will perform its intended function without failure for a specified period.\n",
    "*   **Performance:** The responsiveness of a system to user actions or requests, often measured by latency and throughput.\n",
    "*   **Maintainability:** The ease with which a system can be modified, updated, and debugged.\n",
    "*   **Extensibility:** The ability to extend the system's functionality with minimal impact on existing components.\n",
    "*   **Security:** Protecting the system and its data from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps in System Design\n",
    "\n",
    "A systematic approach helps ensure a robust and efficient design. Here are the typical steps involved:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Requirement Analysis & Clarification:**\n",
    "    *   Understand functional and non-functional requirements (e.g., QPS, latency, storage).\n",
    "    *   Ask clarifying questions to cover edge cases and implicit requirements.\n",
    "    *   Example: \"How many users will be using this system concurrently?\" \"What's the acceptable downtime?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Define System Components & APIs:**\n",
    "    *   Break down the system into smaller, manageable services or components.\n",
    "    *   Define the responsibilities and interfaces (APIs) for each component.\n",
    "    *   Identify data flows between components.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Architecture Choice (Monolith / Microservices / Serverless):**\n",
    "    *   Decide on the overall architectural style that best fits the requirements.\n",
    "    *   Consider trade-offs: ease of deployment, scalability, fault tolerance, development speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Database & Data Storage Design:**\n",
    "    *   Choose appropriate database types (SQL, NoSQL, graph, time-series) based on data characteristics and access patterns.\n",
    "    *   Design schemas, consider indexing, replication, and sharding strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Scaling Strategy:**\n",
    "    *   Plan how to handle increased load: horizontal vs. vertical scaling.\n",
    "    *   Implement load balancing, caching, content delivery networks (CDNs), and queueing mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  **Monitoring, Logging & Alerting:**\n",
    "    *   Integrate tools to observe system health, performance, and potential issues.\n",
    "    *   Set up alerts for critical events.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.  **Fault Tolerance & Disaster Recovery:**\n",
    "    *   Design for graceful degradation and recovery from failures.\n",
    "    *   Implement redundancy, backups, and failover mechanisms."
